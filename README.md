# CSharp-WPF-Mailer
Holiday mailer that allows a user to input names and emails into a sqlite database. The user can choose whether they want to send a holiday email those inputed names, and they have the choice to email only those who have sent ones to them. All users that have been chosen will get an email sent to them. Additional files can be attached to the email.
